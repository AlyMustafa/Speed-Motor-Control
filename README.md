# Speed-Motor-Control-STM32-
Controlling motor speed based on car proximity to obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor. The measured distance is displayed on an LCD screen for monitoring, while the data feeds into a PWM signal to adjust motor speed and avoid collisions. This system ensures safe, efficient vehicle operation by dynamically responding to surrounding objects.
